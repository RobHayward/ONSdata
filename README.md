ONSdata
=======

This includes a series of functions to download and manipulate data.  

My latest line is to get data from the IMF using the API.  I have looked at the information on [IMF help page](http://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/667681-using-json-restful-web-service).  There is some basic code in json_test.R.  So far I have just made a list of the main data sets.
